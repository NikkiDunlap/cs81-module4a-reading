What was the most helpful aspect of this codeâ€™s structure?
The most helpful part of the code was how each function focused on a single task. It made the logic easier to follow and debug. The use of descriptive function names and consistently looping through arrays also helped me understand what was happening without getting overwhelmed.

What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
At first, the mostReadBook() function took longer to understand because of how the book counts were tracked using an object. I had to slow down and walk through how the loop was building the counts and how the second loop figured out which one was the highest. Once I saw how it worked, it made a lot more sense.
